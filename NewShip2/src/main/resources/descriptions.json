An escort carrier or assault transport could be built on a light cruiser hull.",
    "Heavy Cruiser": "Generally considered the smallest capital ship, a heavy cruiser is a serious warship. It can outfight anything it can catch, and outrun anything it can’t outfight. A typical heavy cruiser is about 250 to 300 meters in length and masses about 50,000 metric tons. It carries a crew of 500 to 1,000.",
    "Armored Cruiser": "These vessels often serve as the centerpiece of a raiding or patrolling task force, especially if heavier warships are in short supply.

    "Fortress Ship": "The fortress ship combines the best features of the dreadnought and the super-carrier. It is armed with an impressive main battery, and it embarks hundreds (or maybe even thousands) of small craft, too. A fortress ship might be 2,500 to 4,000 meters in length and weigh as much as 3–5 million metric tons. Crew and passengers could easily approach 100,000 men and women. Like any super-heavy military ships, fortress ships are national assets that serve as the centerpieces of sector defense fleets; they’re almost always accompanied by an escort of dozens of cruisers and destroyers.",

	"Solar Cell": "The solar cell converts light and heat energy from a nearby star into shipboard power through large banks of highly efficient photovoltaic cells and heat exchangers. Within 1 AU (150 million kilometers) of a Sol-type star, the solar cell’s power generation capacity increases by 50 percent; similarly, at a distance of more than 5 AU from a Sol-type star, the solar cell’s power generation capacity drops by 50 percent. Particularly bright stars (class O, B, or A) extend the range of high-efficiency and power drop-off to 2 AU and 10 AU, while very small stars (class K and M) change these figures to 0.5 AU and 2 AU.",
	"Fission Generator": "Also known as an atomic or nuclear power plant, the fission generator extracts energy from a controlled chain reaction of uranium or plutonium. Fission generators require heavy shielding, so small installations are very difficult. However, the technology is easy to apply to large installations. A fission generator’s fuel rods last approximately two to four years, and then must be replaced at a cost of 50,000 per hull point of the power plant.",
	"Fusion Generator": "A fusion generator harnesses the power of nuclear fusion to create shipboard power. A containment device “bottles” the reaction in magnetic fields, since the generator’s core burns at temperatures as hot as the surface of a star. Fortunately, most fusion generators are designed to fail-safe in the event of damage. The fusion generator uses hydrogen for fuel, but like the cold fusion reactor, this is often stored as water.",
	"Grav-Fusion Cell": "Based on a fraal device, the grav-fusion cell employs artificial gravity fields to contain and enhance the performance of a fusion reaction. It’s otherwise similar to the fusion generator.",
	"Antimatter Reactor": "The antimatter reactor annihilates particles of antimatter to create vast amounts of power. Like the fusion generator, it requires some very careful containment procedures, and a significant portion of the generator’s output must be devoted to maintaining the magnetic fields that insulate its fuel source from its surroundings. No fuel tank is required—the antimatter and its containment device are included in the durability cost and price of the reactor. The antimatter reactor requires refueling about once per three to five years, although running at a minimal power configuration (nothing more than life support) could extend this to ten or fifteen years between fueling. Antimatter is expensive; refueling the reactor costs half the amount of money spent on the power plant at the time of its construction.",
	"Mass Reactor": "Dark matter technology presumes that nonbaryonic dark matter may have properties unknown to 20th century science. Specifically, dark matter can undergo a decay process similar to radioactive decay in which energy is released by the transformation of dark matter to “normal matter”. The mass reactor harnesses this fantastic energy. Like the antimatter reactor, the mass reactor requires no fuel tank; the dark matter and its containment device is already included. The mass reactor requires refueling about once every six months, at a cost equal to 5,000 per hull point of the power plant.",
	"Tachyonic Collider": "Tachyons are particles that move faster than the speed of light. The tachyonic collider slows these particles and harnesses their energy. While the collider is expensive and it doesn’t provide as much power as other power systems at this progress level, it has one significant advantage: It doesn’t require any fuel at all.",
	"Dynamic Mass Reactor": "Basically a refinement of the PL 7 mass reactor, the dynamic mass reactor accelerates the decay process, releasing more energy than its predecessor. It’s also a smaller and safer installation. The dynamic mass reactor requires refueling once every six months, at a cost equal to 10,000 per hull point of the power plant. For example, a dynamic mass reactor of 30 durability points costs 300,000 to refuel.",
	"Matter Converter": "This device produces energy through the total conversion of matter. Literally anything can be used as fuel. While the matter converter is expensive, it produces an immense amount of power and requires no significant fuel source.",
	"Quantum Cell": "Harnessing the Holy Grail of energy sources—the quantum fluctuation or zero-point energy observed in vacuum—the quantum cell produces an enormous amount of energy from no fuel source at all.",
	"Singularity Generator": "The singularity generator is an incredibly powerful device that taps the power of a small black hole. It’s not a generator so much as an extremely capacious battery, but the energy contained in a tiny black hole is staggering. Over the course of years, the singularity will shrink as it “evaporates”, or loses energy; the singularity generator must be refueled by the creation of a new black hole. A singularity generator lasts for 10 to 15 years before refueling is required. Refueling costs an amount of money equal to half the cost of the power plant at the time of construction.",

	"-= ENGINE DESCRIPTIONS =-": "-= ENGINE DESCRIPTIONS =-",
	
	"Photon Sail": "This device is an immense but incredibly fragile foil structure only a few molecules thick. It uses light pressure from a nearby star or laser drive station for its motive force. Its acceleration rates drop by 50% if the ship is more than 5 AU distant from the system’s star. The sail can be wrecked by the most minor damage, but every ship equipped with a photon sail carries at least three spares. Unfortunately, it takes hours to stow or deploy a sail. In combat, any weapon hit destroys a deployed photon sail and prevents the sail-ship from making maneuvers until the sail can be re-deployed. The sail-ship will continue on its last course and retain its former speed until it gets a working sail again. Since ships powered exclusively by sails can’t change course easily, assume that all sail-ships are Class I maneuverability. It’s a good idea for a sail-ship to carry a secondary propulsion system such as a small ion engine or rocket for emergency maneuvering and sailing against the sun. Photon sails are completely useless in atmosphere in fact, they’re instantly destroyed by atmospheric entry. Most sail-ships carry a small back-up propulsion system for fine manuvering.",
	"Planetary Thruster": "Several Progress Level 6 engine systems are useless or dangerous in any kind of atmosphere. The planetary thruster is a backup engine system designed specifically for use when the ship’s main drives must be shut down to make planetfall. The most common varieties are the scramjet, chemical rocket, or powered airfoil. The exact form doesn’t matter. The planetary thruster requires either fuel or power, but not both. You can choose to install a standard fuel tank, or to make sure that the ship has enough power available to run a planetary thruster at need.",
	"Fusion Torch": "This engine is basically a fusion reactor with one wall of the magnetic bottle missing; the exhaust is incredibly hot plasma. The fusion torch is intended for space-only work; its exhaust stream would slag anything it landed on and incinerate everything within a few hundred meters of ground zero. Many ships fitted with fusion rockets carry planetary thrusters for atmospheric work, or remain permanently in space, using shuttlecraft to reach a planet’s surface. Its fuel is hydrogen, fused in the reaction chamber and expelled as white-hot plasma.",
	"Ion Engine": "The ion engine uses power to break down molecules of a fuel material to create ions, and then expels them by means of a magnetic impeller. It doesn’t provide the thrust potential of the fusion torch, but it’s much more fuel efficient, and its exhaust is not anywhere near as dangerous. Ion engines don’t function in any kind of atmosphere, so most ships with this kind of power plant also carry a planetary thruster.",
	"Particle Impulse": "This is simply an improved version of the Progress Level 6 ion engine. The particle impulse drive uses magnetic fields to produce a constant stream of high-energy particles and vector it for thrust. Unlike the ion engine, the particle impulse engine doesn’t require a fuel tank. Its reaction is so efficient that the very small amount of matter present in interplanetary or interstellar space can be collected through weak magnetic fields and converted into a thrust medium. The particle impulse engine is capable of atmospheric entry. It causes some damage to any surface close to its exhaust ports, but it’s not too much worse than a modernday jetwash.",
	"Induction Engine": "Hands-down the best engine available at this or any previous Progress Level, the induction engine uses artificial gravity to provide incredible thrust and maneuverability. The induction engine requires no fuel and produces no exhaust; it’s ideal for atmospheric, orbital, or deep-space work.",
	"Inertial Flux Engine": "By precisely controlling the quantum energy level of every atom on the ship simultaneously, the inertial flux engine assumes the inertial states necessary to produce motion in any direction. In effect, the pilot chooses from instant to instant what vector the ship will next possess, and the inertial flux engine makes it possible. This engine requires no fuel and is safe for atmospheric work.",
	"Gravitic Redirector": "A refinement of the induction engine, the gravitic redirector changes the ambient gravity in the vicinity of the ship to produce a motive force. It’s more powerful and more efficient than the induction engine.",
	"Spatial Compressor": "One of the most advanced engines available, the spatial compressor surrounds the ship in a field that “folds” or “wrinkles” the structure of space in the direction the pilot wishes to travel. This results in a continuous series of micro-jumps in which the ship flickers into and out of reality, teleporting thousands of times every second. Since the ship has no intrinsic velocity (it’s stationary while it teleports) the spatial compressor can instantaneously stop or change direction and thrust vector without any maneuvering whatsoever. However, the engine still needs to build up cyclic speed to increase the frequency of its microjumps, so it accelerates normally. The spatial compressor requires a lot of power, but no fuel. It’s safe for atmospheric flight.",
	
	"-= FTL DESCRIPTIONS =-": "-= FTL DESCRIPTIONS =-",
	
	"Jump Drive": "The jump drive relies on a fairly rare technology type, the technology of matter transmission. It requires an enormous amount of power, so much so that the jump drive itself is a colossal fusion device that derives the power for its jump by annihilating massive amounts of hydrogen fuel for a single jump. Thus, the jump drive only requires 5 percent of the ship’s hull points, but it must be built with a fuel tank that may account for anywhere from another 5 to 50 percent of the ship’s hull. A small amount of shipboard power (1 power point per hull point devoted to the jump drive machinery) is also required to control the machinery and direct the jump. The distance a jump drive can teleport in one jump depends on how much of the ship’s mass (i.e., hull points) is annihilated for the jump. For example, a jump ship of 200 hull points might have fuel tanks with a capacity of 60 hull points of fuel—30 percent of the ship’s hull. It could eliminate 10 hull points of fuel (5 percent of the hull) for a jump of 1 light-year, or it could eliminate all 60 fuel points for a jump of 6 light-years. Since most jump ships use most or all of their available fuel in a jump, they need to jump to a point at which they can refuel their tanks. Obviously, a civilized system will have fueling capability, but if fuel can’t be purchased, the jump ship must improvise. Hydrogen can be skimmed from gas giants, separated from water, or mined in the form of ice. Assuming that a suitable source of hydrogen is available, you can assume that a ship requires 1 full day of fueling per 10 hull points of fuel collected. See “Miscellaneous Installations.” The jump drive can execute a jump anytime it has enough fuel to do so. It takes 1d4 hours to cycle the engine and plot the next jump point, so there’s usually a small delay between jumps even if fuel is immediately available.",
	"Wormhole Screen": "It’s theoretically possible for an object such as a ship to pass through a wormhole—a tunnel in space produced by a spectacular event such as the creation of a black hole—and emerge dozens, hundreds, or thousands of light-years from its previous location. However, the simple act of passing through a wormhole triggers its collapse, which makes it difficult to use a wormhole as a means of interstellar travel. The wormhole screen masks the starship’s mass from the wormhole, thus keeping the conduit open long enough for the ship to pass from one end to the other. It also protects the ship from the extreme conditions in the vicinity of the wormhole. The wormhole screen only allows transit along a naturally occurring wormhole, which means that a ship can’t pick its destination; it has to go wherever the wormhole takes it. (In some campaigns, networks of pre-existing artificial wormholes may make it possible to reach a great number of stars in this fashion.) The screen device requires 5 percent of the ship’s hull points, and 2 power points per hull point devoted to the system. A ship of 800 hull points must spend 40 hull points on the screen, and a total of 80 power points to energize the device. Entering a wormhole is a dicey proposition at best, so it takes 2d4 hours to perform the course calculations and maneuvering necessary to initiate a wormhole transit once the ship is in the vicinity of the next wormhole it intends to jump through.",
	"Gate Activator": "This device simply keys a gate device of some kind, which functions as a huge teleporter to another gate somewhere else. It doesn’t require very much power compared to other FTL drives because most of the work is done by the gate itself. The gate activator requires 1 percent of the ship’s hull points (1 hull point per 100 hull points of the ship), and 2 power points per hull point allocated to the system. The ship transiting the gate automatically arrives at the other terminus and cannot jump to a place where no gate exists. The length of the transit may be instantaneous, or it could last for several hours; it depends on the GM’s campaign. A gate device usually requires some cycle time to amass the incredible energies needed to fling a ship across interstellar distances. Again, this is up to the GM, but a period of 2d4 hours as a minimum cycle time is reasonable.",
	"Hyperdrive": "This drive system hurls the ship into an alternate dimension or reality in which the lightspeed limit is meaningless. As with the jump drive, it’s necessary to calculate a destination before entering hyperspace. This requires 1d4 (x) 10 minutes, or a Navigation skill check (complex skill check of 4 successes at no penalty, 10 minutes per check). Once the ship is engaged in a hyperspace jump, it can’t change course. It can drop out of hyperspace at any time simply by disengaging the hyperdrive, and there may be devices or natural phenomena that bar hyperspace travel and interdict any ship passing through the vicinity. A ship’s FTL speed depends on how much of the hull is devoted to the hyperdrive system, with a minimum of 10 percent. Each hull point spent on the hyperdrive requires 3 power points to activate the system. For example, a ship of 300 hull points has a hyperdrive of 45 hull points, or 15 percent of the hull; this requires 135 power points to activate, and provides the ship with a speed of 2 light-years per day of hyperdrive travel. There’s no limit on the length of a jump other than the simple question of how long a ship can remain in hyperspace without refreshing its stores. (The GM may impose a limit of 1000 light-years per hyperjump at his discretion.)",
	"Psychoportive Drive": "Psychoportive drive technology uses the power of the mind to defeat the restrictions of time and space. The psychoportive drive works a lot like a jump drive, except that instead of burning fuel, it burns psionic energy points (or PEPs) as shown below: Class Psi Energy per LY Small 3 PEP per LYLight 6 PEP per LY Medium 10 PEP per LY Heavy 15 PEP per LY Super-Heavy 25 PEP per LY Multiple psionic characters can contribute PEPs to increase the range of the jump. Each psychoportive jump takes one full day. Psionic characters recover their psionic energy points normally after using them on the initial entry into Otherspace. Calculating the probabilities and energies of the next jump requires one psionic character, the navigator, to perform a complex skill check against ESP-navcognition. The navigator requires 4 successes and may make one skill check every ten minutes to prepare the ship for its next jump. The psychoportive drive requires 10 percent of the ship’s hull, and uses 1 point of power per hull point devoted to the drive.",
	"Stardrive": "The stardrive creates a short-lived, controlled singularity that drops the ship out of normal space and into drivespace, a parallel dimension tied to the real universe. All drivespace submergences last for 121 hours (about five days). A stardrive must be coupled to a mass reactor; no other power system can energize a stardrive. Like the hyperdrive or jump drive, a ship powered by a stardrive must plot its jump carefully; it can’t maneuver once it enters drivespace, and nothing can interfere with its progress until it arrives at its destination. The base distance achieved by a stardrive in a single jump is based on the ship class: Class Base Starfall Small 5 LY Light 10 LY Medium 20 LY Heavy 30 LY S-heavy 50 LY The stardrive requires 5 percent of the ship’s hull and 3 power points per hull point of the system; for example, a ship of 80 hull points requires a 4-hull point stardrive and 12 power points to make starfall. It’s possible to increase the distances shown above by exceeding the power requirements found on TABLE 5–5. For every 10 power points beyond the minimum allocated to the stardrive, the ship can starfall one additional light-year. For example, a battleship of 1,000 hull points needs 150 power for its stardrive, but if 300 power points are allocated, it starfalls up to 45 light-years instead of 30 light-years. The stardrive requires several days to recharge after a drivespace journey. Typically, it takes d4+1 days to recharge a stardrive for the next starfall.",
	"Drivewave": "The drivewave generator is simply an improvement of the stardrive. It resembles the earlier engine in most details, except that the length of a drivespace submergence is only 11 hours, and the recharge time for the drive is only d4+1 hours. Since it cycles much faster, it can cover territory at a correspondingly faster pace.",
	"Spacefold Drive": "The spacefold drive “folds space”, making it possible for a ship to leap dozens or hundreds of light-years in a single instant. The range of the drive is determined entirely by the amount of energy used to power the system, as long as it meets the minimums specified on TABLE 5–5. For instance, a 200-hull point ship must allocate 20 hull points to the spacefold drive, which requires 120 power points. As long as the ship can generate 120 or more power points, it can perform a spacefold of up to one light-year per power point assigned to the drive. The spacefold drive can cycle almost instantaneously, but it creates dangerous stresses in the fabric of space; for safety a ship must travel 5d20 (x) 10 AU (astronomical units) from its arrival point in normal space before it’s safe to use the drive again.",
	"Transcendent Drive": "The transcendent drive system harnesses the power of a psionically gifted person and unlocks unfathomable energies with the key of an intelligent mind. The drive permits travel at FTL speeds in normal space with no careful navigation plots or calculations required. The ship’s speed is a number of light-years per hour equal to the psionic energy score of a single psionic character who is flying the ship at any given time. A psionic character who powers the transcendent drive even for a moment immediately expends all of his psionic energy points. He can stay “in the chair” for up to eight hours before becoming exhausted. He can begin to recover psionic energy points normally after he leaves the chair. Example: Jaleel is a fraal mindwalker with 18 psionic energy points. If he takes the helm of a ship fitted with a transcendent drive, the ship will travel at the rate of 18 light-years per hour until Jaleel runs out of steam, at which point another psionic character could take over. Large ships of this type frequently have small teams of pilot-helmsmen who can rotate the piloting duties. The transcendent drive requires 10 percent of the ship’s hull points and a modest amount of power.",
	"Warpdrive": "By creating a warp field in which the normal laws of physics are suspended, the warpdrive permits FTL travel. The warp field does not interfere with a ship’s ability to gather information from its surroundings, and a ship traveling with warp drive can change course, stop, or start again at will, as long as power for the drive is available. Like the hyperdrive, the warp-drive’s speed is measured in the number of light-years it can cross per hour of operation. A ship of 100 hull points that devotes 15 hull points to its warpdrive has allocated 15 percent of hull to the drive, so it can travel at a speed of 4 light-years per hour.",
